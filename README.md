# Vite + React + Tailwind v3 Starter

This project is a minimal starter that uses Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS v3.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:/Users/pc vision/OneDrive/Desktop/New folder"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Common commands:

```powershell
npm run dev    # start dev server
npm run build  # build for production
npm run preview# locally preview production build
```

Notes:
- Tailwind v3 is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs` and included via `src/index.css`.
- If you need a different Tailwind version or PostCSS setup, update `package.json` accordingly.
